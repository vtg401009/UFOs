Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis was to use JavaScript to create a webpage that documents UFO sightings across the
United States.

Results:

Someone might use this webpage by entering in the date in the Enter Date field, the city in the Enter City field,
the state in the Enter State field, country in the Enter Country field, and finally shape in the Enter Shape field.

To clear out the search, click on UFO sightings at the top left of the page.

Summary:

A drawback of this design is there is no way to understand what you can filter on because there is not a list to choose from.

A recommendation for future development is to utilize a list to pick from certain criteria. Also, links to several sources
would drastically improve the credability of this website.
